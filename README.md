# Getting-and-Cleaning-data-Project
This repository contains the final week project of Getting and Cleaning Data.

### DESCRIBING THE DATA
The data-set is basically consisting of an experiment that has been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were observed. The experiments have been 
video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

### CLEANING DATA
The script for cleaning and obtaining tidy data has been developed according to the instructions provided in the problem statement of the project.

### TIDY DATA-SET
A clean and tidy data-set has been generated based on the instructions of the problem statement of the project.
  * Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  * Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  * Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  * Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
  * From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
